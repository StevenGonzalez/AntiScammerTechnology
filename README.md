# AntiScammerTechnology

This script was created to flood an API endpoint of someone who I found that created a fake login screen to steal victims information.
The idea was that if there was enough fake data in their database they would not be able to find legitimate data (hopefully!)
If you use enough threads you could also DDOS them as well (as long as your IP doesn't get blocked). I would def use a VPN while running.
If used for evil I will find you I swear to god.
