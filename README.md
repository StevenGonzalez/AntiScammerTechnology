# AntiScammerTechnology

This script was created to flood an API endpoint of someone who I found that created a fake login screen to steal victims information.
The idea was that if there was enough fake data in their database they would not be able to find legitimate data (hopefully!)
I would def use a VPN while running.
If used for evil I will find you I swear to god.
